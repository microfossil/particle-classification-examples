Overview
========

ParticleTrieur is an application for MacOS and Windows for the organisation, labelling and processing of particle (or other) images. 

* Add images with sample, resolution and other metadata.

* Label images by their taxonomic class, and tag them according to their properties.

* Use in-built AI to help predict the label of an image based on the most similar already labeled images.

* Load a external trained convolutional neural network (CNN) to help label images.

* Process particle images, such as by removing borders, normalising intensity, or centering the particle in the image.

* Calculate morphology information such as circularity or solidity. 

* Export images, by processing them and sorting them into directories by their label.

* See graphs of statistics such as label counts.

* Configure and launch CNN training with the MISO particle classification library.
